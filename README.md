Project 3

You can run the project by setting up two terminals, running the server in the terminal with the IP address specifed in soc.h, running the client in the other.

Use the make file to create executables in each terminal

In the server terminal run ./server

In the client terminal run ./client

The server will say its waiting, once client executable has been ran the server will acknowledge that and wait for moves by the client

Then the game can be played by client choosing and server randomly choosing

The server will acknowldge each move made and so will the client, the result of each game as well as the winner will be shown.
